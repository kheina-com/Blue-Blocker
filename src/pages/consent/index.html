        <h1>Collection of Data Disclosure</h1>
        <p>Really quickly, before you can use Blue Blocker we have to show you this page. Please read carefully so that you can understand how Blue Blocker collects, uses and transmits your user data.</p>
        <p>Blue Blocker collects the following data:
            <div>
                <p>- Cookies and tokens used to make requests to Twitter</p>
                <p>- The URL of all requests made by the Twitter client</p>
                <p>- Responses from Twitter servers</p>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>Your data is used to check if Twitter accounts you run into have Twitter Blue or other features that you configure, and then automatically blocks them</p>
        <p>All data that is stored by the extension is stored locally on device</p>
        <p>Your data is only (re)transmitted to Twitter's servers and/or extensions that you consent to sending data to</p>
        <p>All data that Blue Blocker collects, stores, uses, and transmits is mandatory for the function of the extension</p>

        <span class="inputs">
            <button id="accept">I consent</button>
            <button id="refuse">I do not consent</button>
            <label for="refuse">Because the collection, storage, usage, and transmission of personal data is necessary for the function of this extension, refusing will cause the extension to be uninstalled</label>
